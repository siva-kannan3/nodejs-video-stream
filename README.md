# Streaming videos with nodejs

## Idea

Nodejs streams API helps us to stream a video rather than download the video locally and view it. It works similar like youtube video streaming. Simple yet powerful.

It actually reads a video or text stream and parellely pipe or join the output to response as soon as it reads it. So this way we can avoid the overhead of downloading.
